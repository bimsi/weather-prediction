# weather-prediction
I did a beginner project to predict the weather with Machine Learning.


-	Role: Python developer.
-	Features: Predicting the weather for a single day or week. Testing to make predictions for multiple years. 
-	Python Programming: Utilized Jupyter Notebook for project workflow and data visualization. Cleaned historical weather data, leveraging Excel for initial preprocessing. Created and evaluated a machine-learning model for historical weather prediction. Implemented a testing framework to assess model performance and identify areas for improvement. Enhanced model accuracy by incorporating additional relevant weather predictors.

-	Skills demonstrated: 
•	Machine learning model development in Python.
•	Data cleaning and processing with Excel and Jupyter Notebook. 
•	Testing framework creation and model evaluation.
•	Weather data analysis and feature engineering.
-	Project Outcome: Successfully built a system capable of predicting next-day weather conditions.
